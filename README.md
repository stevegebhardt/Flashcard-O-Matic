# Flashcard-O-Matic

This is my second capstone for Thinkful software engineering program.
In it, a local school has decided to put together a flash card application, Flashcard-o-matic, to help their students study online. Teachers will use this application to create decks of flash cards for the subjects that they teach, and students will study the decks. The school needs you to build the application that the students and teachers will use.

In the app, I was able to keep all of the props read-only, only update state via setState(), the Edit card & Create Cards use a shared form component-also the Create Deck and Edit Deck both share a form component.
Because of the parameters of the project there were only a very few places where we were able to lift state, which was done.

I went above and beyond the requirements and built a sort of JSX template if-you-will for the Breadcrumb component for each of the routes. Each Breadcrumb component is located in one file which uses ternaries to check and compare the url to display the appropriate Breadcrumb trail.

On a final note, CSS was NOT a graded component. However, I used Bootstrap to get all of the pages looking close to the examples given in the instructions.
